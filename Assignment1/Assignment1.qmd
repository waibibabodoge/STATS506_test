## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Problem 1 Wine Data

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
## a)import data
wine <- read.table("/Users/jiayiguo/Desktop/UMich/Fall24/STATS506/Assignment1/wine.data", sep = ",", header = TRUE)

## b)check the report at the number of wines in each class
value_counts <- table(wine$class)
print(value_counts)

## c)
## 1.What is the correlation between alcohol content and color intensity?
## The correlation between alcohol content and color intensity is 0.5463642
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(wine, aes(x=Alcohol, y=Color_intensity))+geom_point()
cor(wine$Alcohol,wine$Color_intensity)
## 2.Which class has the highest correlation? Which has the lowest?
##class=1 has the highest correlation, class=2 has the lowesr correlation
ggplot(wine, aes(x=class, y=Alcohol))+geom_point()
cor(wine$Alcohol,wine$class)
## 3.What is the alcohol content of the wine with the highest color intensity?
##14.34
max_index <- which.max(wine$Color_intensity)
max_Alcohol_CI <- wine$Alcohol[max_index]
print(max_Alcohol_CI)
## 4.What percentage of wines had a higher content of proanthocyanins compare to ash?
pro_ash<-which(wine$proanthocyanins>wine$ash)
total_wine<-length(wine$Alcohol)
print(total_wine)
print(pro_ash/total_wine)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
